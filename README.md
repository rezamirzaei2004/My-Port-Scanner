# My Port Scanner üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello! üëã

This is a simple and small Python script that helps you find open ports on a specific IP address. I created this project to gain a deeper understanding of networking concepts and to work with the powerful `socket` library.

### Why Use It?

- **Simple and Lightweight:** It's a no-frills tool that gets the job done.
- **Educational:** If you're new to networking, this project shows you how ports work in a practical way.
- **Trouble-Free:** It requires no additional libraries and works with Python by default.

### How to Use It

1.  Download the `port_scanner.py` file.
2.  Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.
3.  Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python port_scanner.py [Target IP Address] [Start Port] [End Port]
    ```

**Example:** To scan ports 1 to 100 on your local machine:

```bash
python port_scanner.py 127.0.0.1 1 100
